For most people, drug addicts are lesser human beings: they have no self-control, they indulge and degenerate, they make the society more chaotic (because they are on the loop of drug producing, selling and consuming). But what if, for some drug addicts, who have truly been through devastating things and became beat, that drug is the only reason to live for?

Iâ€™m not advocating for using drugs, but for people above mentioned, should we deplore them and feel good about ourselves? Or should we be ashamed that we did not create, or even choose to create, a society to help unfortunate people get back on their feet?
