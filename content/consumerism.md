Many people blame capitalism for consumerism. There’s one thing they don’t realize: we indulge ourselves in consumerism because we don’t have anything else to do with our lives beside making money and spending money. If we can’t find the thing (or things) that is worthy of devoting our lives to, it’s natural that all we can do is earning and consuming. Maybe the real cause behind consumerism is cycinism and nihilism.
